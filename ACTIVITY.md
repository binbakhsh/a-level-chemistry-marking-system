# Activity Log - AQA Chemistry Automated Marking System

## Current Status: ‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS - Core Implementation Complete

### **Latest Session (2025-08-18)**

#### **‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
1. **Full OpenAI Integration Implementation**
   - Added complete `markSubmission` method to OpenAIMarkingService
   - Comprehensive prompt engineering for AQA chemistry marking
   - Question-by-question analysis with detailed feedback
   - Database schema updates with new fields (`totalScore`, `grade`, `MARKING` status)
   - Successfully applied database migration

2. **Complete Automated Pipeline**
   - ‚úÖ Mark scheme upload ‚Üí OCR ‚Üí AI parsing (100% accuracy: 17/17 questions, 23/23 marks)
   - ‚úÖ Student submission ‚Üí OCR processing 
   - ‚úÖ OpenAI marking integration implemented
   - ‚úÖ Results storage and retrieval system
   - ‚úÖ Grade calculation (A*-U scale)

#### **üö® CURRENT ISSUE - Results Display Failure**

**Problem Description:**
- Student successfully uploaded answer sheet
- System showed "MARKING" status briefly (indicating processing started)
- When clicking to view results: **"Failed to Load Results - Results not found"**

**Technical Analysis:**
- OCR processing appears to work (previous session confirmed 5,349 characters extracted)
- Marking process initiated (MARKING status appeared)
- Issue occurs during marking execution or result storage
- Frontend receives no results from `/marking/submissions/:id/results` endpoint

**Potential Root Causes:**
1. **OpenAI API Failure**: Marking request may have failed during execution
2. **Database Storage Issue**: Results not properly saved to `marking_results` table
3. **Error Handling**: Submission status not updated to FAILED when marking fails
4. **API Response Format**: Results endpoint returning wrong structure
5. **Authentication/Permission**: User access validation failing

**Error Location Likely:**
- `backend/src/routes/submissions.ts:processSubmissionAsync()` - OpenAI marking step
- `backend/src/services/openaiService.ts:markSubmission()` - AI marking execution  
- `backend/src/routes/marking.ts` - Results retrieval endpoint

#### **Next Steps for Resume:**
1. **Check Backend Logs**: Examine server logs for OpenAI API errors or database failures
2. **Test OpenAI Connection**: Verify API key and service connectivity
3. **Debug Marking Process**: Add detailed logging to identify where marking fails
4. **Validate Database**: Check if marking results are being stored correctly
5. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and user feedback during marking failures

#### **Previous Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Perfect mark scheme parsing (17/17 questions, 100% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ Student OCR processing (5,349 characters successfully extracted)
- ‚úÖ Professional UI workflow with notifications
- ‚úÖ Database schema and migrations
- ‚úÖ Authentication and file upload systems

## **Development History**

### **Phase 1 - Foundation (Completed)**
- Project setup and authentication system
- Database design with Prisma
- File upload functionality with Multer

### **Phase 2 - OCR Integration (Completed)**  
- MathPix OCR API integration
- PDF processing pipeline
- Mark scheme parsing with 100% accuracy

### **Phase 3 - AI Marking (90% Complete)**
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration implemented
- Comprehensive marking algorithms
- **ISSUE**: Results not displaying properly after marking

### **Phase 4 - Testing & Deployment (Pending)**
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

## **Technical Stack Status**
- ‚úÖ Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ Backend: Express.js + Prisma ORM  
- ‚úÖ Database: PostgreSQL with latest migrations
- ‚úÖ OCR: MathPix API (working perfectly)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI: OpenAI GPT-4o (integration complete, execution issue)
- ‚úÖ Authentication: JWT-based system

## **Key Files Modified Recently**
- `backend/src/services/openaiService.ts` - Added markSubmission method
- `backend/src/routes/submissions.ts` - Enhanced with OpenAI marking
- `backend/src/routes/marking.ts` - Updated results endpoint
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added marking fields
- Database migration: `20250818195138_add_marking_fields`

---

**Resume Point**: Debug OpenAI marking execution failure preventing results display
**Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality affected
**Impact**: Students cannot see marking results despite successful upload and OCR
